## Hi there!
Looking for an easy way to integrate your [VideoTaxi](https:/video.taxi) videos on your WordPress page?

## Installation
Simply upload the `videotaxi.php.zip` file to your WordPress backend, install and activate the plugin.

## Usage
Create a shortcode element in the block editor and paste `[videotaxi id=XYZ]` with `XYZ` as your unique VideoTaxi video ID - that's it! The video will be displayed in the frontend.
